  longDescriptionMarkdown: `
I visited the [The Hepworth Wakefield](https://hepworthwakefield.org/)
recently and was captivated by a work
called _Leaving (With Two-Minute Silence)_ which was part of the
["Anthony McCall: Solid Light Works" exhibition (16 Feb - 3 June 2018)](https://hepworthwakefield.org/whats-on/anthony-mccall-solid-light-works/).
I thought it would be interesting to try to re-create the effect using
JavaScript and three.js.
